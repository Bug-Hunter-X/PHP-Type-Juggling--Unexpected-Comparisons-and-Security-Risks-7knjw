This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in PHP related to type juggling when comparing strings to integers. The `bug.php` file showcases the vulnerability, while `bugSolution.php` illustrates how to fix it using strict comparison.  Loose comparison in PHP can cause unexpected behavior, particularly in security-sensitive contexts where user input is involved. Always use strict comparison (`===`) to ensure accurate comparisons and prevent unexpected type conversions.
