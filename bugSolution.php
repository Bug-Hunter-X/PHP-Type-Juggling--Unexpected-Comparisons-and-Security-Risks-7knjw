The solution lies in using strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison checks for both value and type equality, preventing the implicit type conversion that causes the error.  The corrected code should look like this:
```php
<?php
$userInput = '5abc';
$expectedValue = 5;

if ($userInput === $expectedValue) {
    echo "Values are equal in type and value.";
} else {
    echo "Values are not equal."; //This branch will execute because of strict comparison
}
?>
```
By using strict comparison, you eliminate the vulnerability of implicit type conversion. This ensures that only values that are both numerically equal to 5 and are integers will pass the check, significantly improving security and the reliability of your code.
